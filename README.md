## About Me

I love forging products. Its not just building, but continuously shaping, learning, and refining along the way. Just like a blacksmith who forges a sword!
Most of what I know comes from working on real projects, breaking stuff, fixing it, and getting better with each attempt.

Still learning. Still forging.
